## Hi there üëã

### üè† Who are we?

LaVague.ai is the team behind [LaVague](https://github.com/lavague-ai/LaVague), which aims to leverage AI to automate the mundane tasks we are faced with personally and at work. 

We are an off-shoot of [Mithril Security](https://github.com/mithril-security/), a startup focused on democratizing privacy-by-design AI through open-source projects. 

We want to bring together our expertise in AI along with expertise in the wider community to build a groundbreaking open-source automation tool.
